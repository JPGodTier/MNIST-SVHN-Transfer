/home/infres/olapabe-23/MNIST-SVHN-Transfer/src/solvers/CyCADASolver.py:454: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`).
  fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=10, figsize=(15, 4))  # Set up the subplot grid
